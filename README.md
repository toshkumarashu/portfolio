Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the website's content.
CSS3: For styling the webpage, with flexbox and media queries for responsive design.
JavaScript: For smooth scrolling and form handling.
Google Fonts: Poppins font for a modern and clean look.
Structure
The website consists of the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that contains the content and structure of the website.
style.css: A CSS file that defines the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements.
code.js: A JavaScript file that manages smooth scrolling and basic form validation.
web-photo.jpg: An image file representing my profile picture.
How to Use
Local Setup
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Ensure the style.css, code.js, and web-photo.jpg are in the same directory as the index.html.
Smooth Scrolling
The navigation links use JavaScript to scroll smoothly to the relevant sections. The links in the navigation bar reference IDs in the HTML (#home, #about, #projects, #contact).

Contact Form
The contact form currently performs basic front-end validation to ensure the fields are filled before submission.
On form submission, a "Thank You" message is displayed (you will need to further handle backend logic to send messages if needed).
Project Sections
Home Section: Introduces who I am with a profile picture and a short welcome message.
About Section: Describes my educational background, skills, and professional aspirations.
Projects Section: Features a project (Movie Recommendation System) with a link to the GitHub repository.
Contact Section: Provides my contact details, such as email and location, along with a form to send a message.
